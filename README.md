### Team: Adrià Cabeza, Raimon Mercè, Bernat Torres, Ferran Velasco



> Aren't you tired to wake up and see all this bad news? Don't you want to start your day in a happy way? That's why we created **SOMA** (the name comes from Brave New World, the novel by Aldoux Huxley). This amazing webapp will show you only the daily news that you want to see: the positive ones. Live a happy and warming life with SOMA! (You do have the options to see only the negative ones too tho).

This project is mainly separed by two parts, the Python one, where we used tweepy (for the Twitter issues) and TextBlob to analyse the sentiment of the tweets (positive or negative) and the WebApp one, where we used the data from the Firebase Database(using js) and created a beautiful and responsive webapp using HTML5+CSS3, Jquery, Bootstrap.
