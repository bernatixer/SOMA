> Aren't you tired to wake up and see all this bad news? Don't you want to start your day in a happy way? That's why we created **SOMA** (the name comes from Brave New World, the novrl by Aldoux Huxley )

This project is mainly separed by two parts, the Python one, where we used tweepy (for the Twitter issues) and TextBlob to analyse the sentiment of the tweets (positive or negative) and the WebApp one, where we used the data from the Firebase Database(using js) and created a beautiful and responsive webapp using HTML5+CSS3, Jquery, Bootstrap.
